# Summary

After you have completed your work at the level of this application, first implement the following in this application:
1. Implement the removal of students from a group
2. Implement the option to cancel changes while retaining the existing value
3. Implement validation to ensure that codes of the same type are unique (e.g. there cannot be two programmes with the same code value)
4. Visually refine the application (UI/UX)
5. Add statistics to the Groups menu (this is difficult and requires independent research)
	- Total number of students across all groups
	- Average number of students per group
	- Total revenue per programme
	- Average revenue per participant
	- Earliest and latest group start dates, including the number of days between these dates

After that, apply all these tasks to your own application (adjusting the content to fit your entities)
